#100 Days of SVG

Visit the project at [100daysofsvg.com](http://github.com/laurelobrien/100daysofsvg) 

100 Days of SVG is part of #the100dayproject; choose something to make and then make it for 100 days. As an exercise in html/css and illustration, I am making 100 [scalable vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) illustrations that can be displayed and scaled on the web rather than slapped into place as a static png.

##Where can I learn more about 100 day projects?

[The Great Discontent](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/elle-luna-100-day-project) has a good interview about it with Elle Luna, as well as some prompts and ideas for your own. The about page of my project has a list of my favourites, but [100 Days of Fonts](http://100daysoffonts.com/) was the one that got me goin' and is a really delightful example of web typography.
