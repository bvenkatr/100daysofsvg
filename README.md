#100 Days of SVG

[100 Days of SVG](http://github.com/laurelobrien/100daysofsvg) is part of #the100dayproject; choose something to make and make it for 100 days straight. As an exercise in html/css and illustration, I am making 100 [scalable vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) illustrations that can displayed and scaled on the web rather than slapped into place as a static png.

##Where can I learn more about 100 day projects?

[The Great Discontent](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/elle-luna-100-day-project) has a good interview about it with Elle Luna, as well as some prompts and ideas for your own. The about page of my project has a list of my favourites, but [100 Days of Fonts](http://100daysoffonts.com/) was the one that got me goin' and is a really delightful example of web typography.
